                                <p>The features for the 3 packages we offer are noted on the Fees & Packages page. If
                                    you choose the Plus or the Professional packages, you will receive a complete
                                    website with your text, photos, and keywords. You just have to send us your material
                                    and we do all the rest. We create the website, setup your web hosting, optimize your
                                    site for the search engines, publish your new site, and send you the instructions
                                    for making changes to your new site. With the Basic site, we still add your logo,
                                    social media links, contact details and page tiltes to the template of your choice.
                                    You will have access to go into the admin panel on each page to add your own
                                    content.</p>

                                <p class="post">What is the total cost?</p>
                                <p>Our template fees are only one-time fees to setup the website for you. The only
                                    recurring fee is the website support and hosting fee which can be found on our Fees
                                    & Packages page. There are NO other hidden or maintenance fees with our service.</p>

                                <p class="post">Can I have more than 12 pages or a custom number of pages?</p>
                                <p>Yes, our website packages have varying numbers of pages but every website we create
                                    allows you the flexiblity to add more pages via the CMS. If you would prefer that we
                                    setup all the pages you need when we create the site, just let us know how many
                                    pages you need and we will provide you with a custom quote..</p>

                                <p>Our turn-around time to create a daycare website is very fast! Once we have your
                                    template choice, your logo, text, photos, etc, we can create your new website within
                                    1 week and publish the site to a temporary website address for you to review. At
                                    that point, you can request changes before we take your site live. Our normal
                                    response time is within 1 business day.</p>

                                    details, which template you would like, any options you are interested in, etc.

                                <p>A template is a pre-designed website that is essentially a "shell" for your content
                                    and photos. The layout is already established so we only need to populate the
                                    website with your custom page titles, page content, and photos. Our daycare themed
                                    templates are designed by expert graphic artists and are modern, professional, and
                                    very effective!</p>

                                <p class="post">Can I have a custom-designed site?</p>
                                <p>Yes! We can create a 100% custom and tailored site with custom graphics, custom
                                    pages, etc. Many of our clients prefer to send their logo and graphics and have us
                                    create a unique design for a more custom look. Please review our Features page for
                                    details. You can also review our Child Care Custom Website Design Gallery for some
                                    live websites.</p>

                                <p>When we create your new website using one of our templates, we can create a simple
                                    text-based logo if you do not have a logo for your childcare business. If you want a
                                    professional logo designed by our very talented illustrators, we can do that as
                                    well. You will receive 5 to 6 unique and custom concepts (no clip art), unlimited
                                    revisions on the chosen concept, and all of the final files in multiple formats for
                                    use on the web, print, and other mediums. We will forward you a logo questionnaire
                                    before getting started so that we can ensure the logo is developed according to your
                                    preference and expectation.</p>

                                <p>You can type out your text in a single document file (Microsoft Word is preferred),
                                    noting which page the text is for. In this file, you can also include your top
                                    keyword phrases for the search engines. You can then attach that file to an email
                                    and then also attach any photos you want for the website (we recommend about 1 or 2
                                    per page.) You would forward the email with all content to
                                    info@daycaredeviser.com</p>

                                <p class="post">Can I use my photos for the new site?</p>
                                <p>Yes! We have an extensive stock photo library of children that we can use throughout
                                    the site but if you would prefer we use your images on each page, that works for us!
                                    Just send us 1 or 2 photos to use per page to highlight your content - depending on
                                    the length of contnet for each page.</p>

                                <p>Yes, most of our clients do have some type of Forms or Enrollment page where they
                                    include links to PDF forms. There is, of course, no extra charge for us to set this
                                    up for you and you can also add more of these types of links via the CMS once the
                                    site goes live. These attachments do not count as pages so you don't have to factor
                                    them into your page count.</p>

                                <p class="post">What if I need you to make changes to my site later?</p>
                                <p>You will have the ability to edit your own content on each page but we will always be
                                    available to you if you need us to make changes to your site like creating custom
                                    graphics, changing the layout design of your site, adding new pages, new forms, etc.
                                    You can simply email us at info@websitesfordaycares.com with the details and we can
                                    provide a quote.</p>

                                <p class="post">Can I change the titles / links of the pages?</p>
                                <p>Yes - you can change the names of the pages to anything you would like. We just used
                                    example titles for the purposes of displaying the templates but you are free to
                                    title the pages to suit your requirements.</p>

                                    yourself via the content management system. You'll be able to add as much or as
                                    little text as you want to every page of your site.</p>

                                    SUPER easy to use and you can edit your content (text/photos/video) from anywhere
                                    and at anytime. You do not need to download any new software or know any HTML code
                                    in order to use the system. It is a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) interface
                                    and is very similar to working in Microsoft Word. It is browser-based so you can
                                    login and edit your site from wherever you have an internet connection and a
                                    browser.</p>

                                <p class="post">Can I change my own copy and photos on each page?</p>
                                <p>Yes! You can insert your own photos, text, upload PDF files, even insert videos and
                                    scripts, easily via the backend.</p>

                                <p class="post">Do I have to download any software or know any HTML?</p>
                                <p>No, our content management system is web-based and you can access it and edit your
                                    website easily via your web browser. The interface is similar to using Microsoft
                                    Word - you will not need to know any HTML to edit your website.</p>

                                <p>Yes, we optimize every website we create with your top keyword phrases for maximum
                                    exposure on the search engines.</p>

                                <p class="post">What are SEO keywords?</p>
                                <p>When we create your new website, we want it to have the best chance of receiving a
                                    lot of hits from the major search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Bing) and in order to
                                    do that, we need to incorporate your top keyword phrases into the website code
                                    during development. When your new site goes live, the search engines will index and
                                    rank your new website based on those keywords. So if you are located in Atlanta, you
                                    might include "Atlanta Childcare" and "Atlanta Daycare Center" or "Atlanta Learning
                                    Center" in your keywords list. You want to think in terms of what your potential
                                    customer would be searching for on the search engines to find your business.</p>

                                <p>In order for a website to be displayed on the internet, the website pages have to be
                                    hosted on a web server. Our web hosting service allows your website pages to be
                                    hosted as well as email hosting. We help you every step of the way to setup the
                                    hosting, setup email accounts, connect email accounts with your email program,
                                    etc.</p>

                                <p class="post">Will I lose my domain name if I move my site to you?</p>
                                <p>Absolutely not. You can keep your domain and current site active and live until we
                                    have your new site ready. Then we'll seamlessly redirect your domain to our servers
                                    which will display your new site and deactivate your old one.</p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p class="post">Will my current site go down during this process?</p>
                                <p>No, your website won't have any downtime whatsoever. We don't make any changes to
                                    your current site while we are building your new site. Once the new site is ready on
                                    our servers, we just have to login to your domain registrar and "point" your domain
                                    to our servers. This will then take your visitors directly to the new site and then
                                    you can release your old hosting provider for your old site. It's really easy and
                                    really quick!</p>

                                    fully-managed hosting servers are equipped with unlimited email accounts, unlimited
                                    monthly emails, unlimited phone and email support, and unlimited monthly bandwidth
                                    or traffic. You will have full cpanel access and if you should ever require more
                                    disk space, we can upgrade you to a more suitable hosting plan.</p>

                                    email accounts like "info@daycaredeviser.com" We will send you instructions on how
                                    to setup email accounts in your web hosting control panel and also how to send and
                                    receive email using that new email account. As always, we are here to help for any
